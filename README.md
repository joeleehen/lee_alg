  I've been taking a linear algebra class and reading the Rust book at the same time so I thought it prudent to get some experience Rust experience by combining the two. Here's a rudimentary library for working with square
  matrices. I named it *lee-alg* as a little play on words with Lie Algebra and my middle name. That's a little humor for ya.

  I'm still very new to Rust so this library is lacking in efficiency and optimization. If you're looking for an actual library for linear algebra in Rust, you should look elsewhere! This is meant to be a 
  pedagogical exercise to get more comfortable with Rust.

  There are a few concepts I encountered in class that I thought lent themselves well to a programmatic approach. Here's a list of functionality I'd like to add:
  - [ ] extracting column vectors from a matrix (and vice versa)
  - [ ] Enforcing square matrices on construction
  - [ ] Calculating determinants (hence the square requirement)
  - [ ] Dot products
  - [ ] Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization Process
  - [ ] Transposition


I don't wanna do any row reduction so I pretend it doesn't exist ðŸ˜´ðŸ˜‡
